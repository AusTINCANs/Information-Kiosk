2015 kiosk
==========

This repo is for all code and media (excluding large videos, please host elsewhere) for the kiosk. The kiosk is a touchscreen display that we utilize at events and competitions as a psuedo-team-member. It steps in for us when everyone else is busy, to provide a rich, entertaining, and informative experience. Target audience ranges from random people who know nothing about FIRST, to judges, to other FIRST team members. 

There's also a Slack channel #kiosk for intra-team discussions.
