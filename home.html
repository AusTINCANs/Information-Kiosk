            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Team 2158 - the ausTIN CANs, was founded in 2007. Since being recognized with the Rookie All-Star Award, we have worked to transform our culture and inspire the next generation of innovators and engineers. As Austinites identifying with the famous motto: “Keep Austin Weird,” our team members collaborate to promote STEM in imaginative ways. </p>
                <br></br>
            <p>
Every year, the CANs introduce new educational opportunities, activities, and outreach that feed into Austin technology landscape. We support our local partners and teams, inspire community members to start new FIRST teams, and host competitions and other events. The culmination of our efforts cultivates STEM learning and strengthens FIRST’s message in our community.

            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <h1>Opportunity Cost</h1>
            <p>After we've thought of potential strategies, we try to figure out which of those strategies is most worth pursuing. We look at things like material costs, and development times for mechanisms, to find relationships between costs and the opportunity for a return, hence opportunity cost.
</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>This analysis gives us an numerical analysis of different strategies and ideas, and helps us build the most realistic and effective robot build roadmap that we can. With only six weeks, you can’t do everything!</p>
            <h1>Solidworks Materials Testing</h1>
            <p>Team 2158's partnership with UT Austin and ongoing associate, professional and expert level CAD (computer aided design) certification programs have allowed for a more advanced understanding of Solidworks (CAD software we use). Last year, the team began material stress testing within Solidworks as part of routine design - a step which has allowed us to ensure that parts we build will be able to withstand the forces that they might experience in the field.
</p>
            <br></br>
    <p>By performing analysis like this in CAD software, we’re able to cut down on wasted time and material, and focus on solutions that work.

            <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>Our manufacturing department takes instructions and designs from CAD and mechanisms, and turns those drawings and models into real parts. </p>
            <br></br>
            <h1>CNC Mill and CNC Lathe</h1>
<p>Advanced CAD techniques have also impacted fabrication. We recently acquired CNC mill and lathe technology through partnership with the Austin ISD and Texas Workforce Commission, which we utilize precisely machine parts. Having the ability to do so allows us to make improvements that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible, such as the placement of lightening holes in our intake arm struts.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h1>3D Printed Components</h1>
<p>3D printing makes it easy for us to not only rapidly prototype parts, but also develop elements for use in our robot - parts can be designed to be strong, rigid, and light, but can also be designed and fabricated with speed not possible with other manufacturing processes. 
On this year’s robot, we designed several parts that are in use, such as sliding connection elements used in our lift. In our entrepreneurship program, students utilize the printer to develop low-cost prototypes, or even for production purposes.

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
The programming department for the ausTIN CANs works with LabVIEW, a visual programming language developed by National Instruments. We learn how to interact with systems and how to devise logical steps to complete processes. Our members come from a variety of backgrounds: some have written code for years and others have never seen a programming environment in their lives, but all are welcome and accepted as part of our group. The difference in skill levels helps us to teach new coders quickly, while training the advanced programmers to teach these skills as well.

            <h1>Engineering Education</h1>
<p>            2158 expands STEM education within Anderson High School and the Austin Independent School District via the influence of FIRST. To grow the program, in 2012 we secured $500,000 by impressing funders with our FIRST success, petitioning the school board, and registering for 501(c)3 status. This past year, we have secured funds for a new $2 million 14,000 sq.ft. engineering facility at our school. The facility will make Anderson a hub for engineering education in Austin, with programs to bring up to 500 students annually from around our district to share in the resources and opportunities provided. 
            </p>
            <br></br>
<p>
We shaped engineering education at our school for 1,000+ students since 2009 (300 in 2014-15 alone). The program offers 14 unique courses and access to our state-of-the-art machine shop. Students receive college credit and professional CAD certifications (so far 60 Associates and 8 Professional) to give them an edge in college.
            </p>
            <br></br>
<h2>Global impact</h2>
<p>
Our members impact the world. Past students have travelled to Rio de Janeiro to work at a non-profit and enabled kids to escape poverty by teaching them computer skills and developed a life support system scheduled for use on the ISS. Others have worked at UT Austin research labs to develop clean water technologies and participated the Aerospace Scholars summer program. 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
94% of 72 team graduates study STEM at colleges like Harvard, Cornell, Tufts, UT Austin, A&M, and the US Naval Academy. Alumni have started and mentor 4 FRC teams, volunteer for FIRST, and support our team.
</p>
<br></br>
<h2>CAN Talks</h2>
<p>
We hold monthly CAN Talks (Careers, Academics, and Networking) to share stories and expertise of professionals with our community, and the web, through TED-esque presentations. We’ve connected students to 25 speakers from Apple, Qualcomm, ARM, Boeing, National Instruments (NI), Oracle, Texas Instruments, UT Austin, and more.

    <h1>Entrepreneurship Education</h1>
     <br></br>
     <p>
     The ausTIN CANs provide students with real-world experiences. In 2012, we garnered support from Rackspace and 3-Day Startup to co-found High School Startup. High School Startup teaches teens the value of entrepreneurship within engineering by engaging them in the creation of a product. It takes students through phases of product development - brainstorming, market research, prototyping, and launch. 
     </p>
     <br></br>
<p>
Students crowdfunded their projects, including a new gearbox for robotics, a smartphone app for FRC scouting, and a musical instrument tuner. One group was featured on the Kickstarter homepage as a Staff Pick; their project video was seen over 15,000 times. 
</p>
<br></br>
<h2>Entrepreneurship Courses</h2>
<p>Since our success with High School Startup, we’ve started entrepreneurship courses at Anderson - our two courses take students through the process of designing and developing a product. Students have been through supply chain logistic courses, and participate in tours of local businesses and accelerator programs, as well as develop tenable businesses. 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
The program gives students the opportunity to learn skills necessary to launch a successful business venture in an educational environment.
